# Application
A work tracking web application written for tracking development work associated with my personal projects.

# Technology
Written in Python using the Django web framework.

# Design
The website follows a simple design. There is a home page listing all projects hosted by the site. Anyone may view the projects without logging in. To contribute to a project, you must log in & be assigned to work on that project by the owner. Each project contains two views. One lists work items in a tree-like fashion, the other displays work items in the form of a kanban board.
